Designed to supply Festo pipetting systems and liquid handling systems in the life sciences with compressed air and vacuum.

The PGVA-1's usage can be extended to other areas as well to aspirate and dispense as a function of the pressure/vacuum levels generated by the PGVA.

## Driver Languages
* Python
* Java
* .NET/C#

## Methods
* **Aspirate** -
  * Purpose:      Aspirates (creates a vacuum) at the given pressure for the given amount of time
  * Value Ranges: actuationTime = 0 to 1000 ms, pressure = -450 to 0 mBar
  * Arguments:    int actuationTime (ms), int pressure (mBar)
  * Returns:      void
* **Dispense** -
  * Purpose:      Dispenses (creates an output pressure) at the given pressure for the given amount of time
  * Value Ranges: actuationTime = 0 to 1000 ms, pressure = 0 to 450 mBar
  * Arguments:    int actuationTime (ms), int pressure (mBar)
  * Returns:      void
* **Calibration** -
  * Purpose:      Sets the maximum, minimum, and zero pressure set points
  * Value Ranges: NONE
  * Arguments:    void
  * Returns:      void
* **SetPumpPressure** -
  * Purpose:      Sets pressure and vaccum threshold values in mBar
  * Value Ranges: pressure = 0 to 550 mBar, vacuum = -550 to 0 mBar
  * Arguments:    int pressure (mBar), int vacuum (ms)
  * Returns:      void
* **ReadSensorData** -
  * Purpose:      Reads the actual vaccum, pressurem and output pressure values from the device in mBar
  * Value Ranges: NONE
  * Arguments:    void
  * Returns:      int[] data (data[0] = vacuum, data[1] = pressure, data[2] = output pressure)
